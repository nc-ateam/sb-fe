# Stampbook (Front-End)

Stampbook is a collection album app, where users take photographs close to landmarks and check them off of their collections. This repo is for the front-end.

## Built With

This application has been built with the following -

```
React 16.3.1
React-Native 0.55.2
React-Native-Camera 1.2.0
React-Native-Maps 0.21.0
React-Navigation 2.11.2
Expo 27.1.1
Shoutem/ui 0.23.4
```

Many thanks to the team behind [expo/camerja](https://github.com/expo/camerja) for the example camera code.

### Prerequisites

To run the app, you will need an `iOS 11+` device. There is currently no support for android devices.

You will need to install the `expo` app from the iOS App Store.

## Getting Started

1.  Fork and Clone this repository to your machine.
2.  Open the `SB-FE` directory in your terminal and type `npm install`.
3.  Once dependencies are installed, you should be able to run `npm start` to build under `expo`.
4.  Follow the instructions in the terminal when expo has built the app. You will have to use your device to open the app.

For `macOS` users, it is possible to open the app in a simulator. You will need to install the latest version of `XCode`. If you would like to do this, follow the above steps, but instead of using your device, opt to run the app in a simulator.

### Potential Issue -

If you're using `macOS` to build the app in `expo`, you may run into [this issue](https://github.com/nc-ateam/sb-fe/issues/76) regarding system resources.
