Many thanks to the team behind [expo/camerja](https://github.com/expo/camerja) for the example camera code.

### Prerequisites

To run the app, you will need an `iOS 11+` device. There is currently no support for android devices.

You will need to install the `expo` app from the iOS App Store.

## Getting Started

1.  Fork and Clone this repository to your machine.
2.  Open the `SB-FE` directory in your terminal and type `npm install`.
3.  Once dependencies are installed, you should be able to run `npm start` to build under `expo`.
4.  Follow the instructions in the terminal when expo has built the app. You will have to use your device to open the app.

For `macOS` users, it is possible to open the app in a simulator. You will need to install the latest version of `XCode`. If you would like to do this, follow the above steps, but instead of using your device, opt to run the app in a simulator.
